/**
 * "villager" — the single Hollow personality kind. Maps need pressure,
 * genome, and the day-cycle ROUTINE (chunk hollow-14c, re-textured by
 * hollow-14c-2's rare/private throttle) to a prioritized intention queue:
 *
 *   1. food need at/below SEEK_THRESHOLD_FRACTION → seek + consume a food node
 *   2. else rest need at/below REST_SEEK_THRESHOLD_FRACTION → rest in place
 *   3. else the day-cycle ROUTINE (`world/day-cycle.ts`'s `dayPhase`) branches
 *      by phase:
 *        - GATHER → path toward the hearth (`world/grid.ts`'s `HEARTH_TILE`)
 *          — the dusk convergence. Once there (arrived, nothing left to path
 *          toward), this is the town's ONE PUBLIC social window (chunk
 *          hollow-14c-2): an UNRESTRICTED (cross-family) social-verb attempt,
 *          still gated by the per-agent cooldown (below) — see step 4. If no
 *          verb fires, idle (nothing else queued this phase).
 *        - SLEEP → disperse toward the agent's home anchor (its community's
 *          territory centroid, or its own current tile if it's a loner —
 *          see `homeAnchor`) so it doesn't sleep on the hearth. Once there, a
 *          RESTRICTED (household/close-tie only) social-verb attempt, same
 *          cooldown gate — a quiet exchange before turning in, per the
 *          brief's "rare, private" instruction covering every phase but
 *          GATHER. If no verb fires, idle.
 *        - WORK / COMMUTE → a RESTRICTED social-verb attempt (same gate),
 *          falling back to work (step 5) if nothing fires — this is the
 *          brief's "day-to-day cooperation is rare and private" case: most
 *          of the day, most attempts are suppressed by the household/
 *          close-tie candidate filter and the cooldown, so the bulk of what
 *          used to be constant public helping simply doesn't fire anymore.
 *   4. RESTRICTED vs UNRESTRICTED social-verb attempt (chunk hollow-06b,
 *      `agents/social-verbs.ts`'s `chooseSocialAction`), gated by BOTH:
 *        - the per-agent cooldown (`SOCIAL_COOLDOWN_TICKS`,
 *          `HollowAgent.lastSocialActTick`) — an agent may INITIATE at most
 *          one social verb per that many ticks, tick arithmetic only, no
 *          `Rng` (chunk hollow-14c-2);
 *        - the day-phase gate above: GATHER passes `restrictToCloseTies:
 *          false` (the public window); WORK/COMMUTE/SLEEP pass `true` (the
 *          candidate set is filtered to household-mates + high-trust close
 *          ties — see social-verbs.ts's `isCloseTie`).
 *      Only fires if the winning verb also clears `SOCIAL_ACTION_MIN_SCORE`.
 *   5. else (WORK/COMMUTE only) → work the nearest material node (produces
 *      goods → wealth), OR the nearest FOOD node if the agent's
 *      leader-assigned `occupation.role` (chunk hollow-14b,
 *      components/occupation.ts) is "food-gatherer" — see
 *      `fallbackWorkNodeKind` below. GATHER/SLEEP never fall through to work
 *      — an agent that skips its one social roll there just idles in place
 *      (still AT the hearth/home), not wander off to a work node.
 *
 * The survival ladder (1-2) is UNCHANGED from hollow-03/05 and always wins —
 * everything below is only even consulted once neither fires (a hungry/
 * exhausted agent ignores the routine/social/work ladder entirely — survival
 * always interrupts it). Two behavior genes are wired directly into the
 * ladder itself: `industriousness` shifts the rest-seek threshold (chunk
 * hollow-05, `restSeekThreshold` below); the REST of the behavior genes
 * (sociability/risk/aggression/loyalty/greed/curiosity) drive the
 * social-verb scoring in step 4 (chunk hollow-06b) — see social-verbs.ts and
 * social/deliberation-constants.ts for the exact couplings.
