# Project Status

Current-state **snapshot** (2026-06-11). Terse one-liner per brief here; full implementation detail lives in each brief file ([briefs/](../briefs/)), recent passes in [log.md](../log.md) (older entries trimmed → git history), live design gaps in [open-questions.md](open-questions.md).

**Where things stand:** engine briefs 01–09 and game briefs 01–79 are **Done or Superseded**; queued briefs: **[80-fishing-cast-tiles-stale](../briefs/game/todo/80-fishing-cast-tiles-stale.md)**, **[82-agent-movement-interpolation](../briefs/game/todo/82-agent-movement-interpolation.md)**, and **[83-visual-depth-polish](../briefs/game/todo/83-visual-depth-polish.md)** (render-only polish wave: bridge rope railings, sandy-shore descent, 3D house faces, granular near-shore water — no open-thread diagnosis needed, just art+code work). Tests + typecheck green. **Three open threads**, all diagnosed, none fixed:
1. **Tier-0 FPS regression** — canvas raster, not DOM/particles ([performance.md](performance.md) Tier 0); the relmatrix DOM-thrash fix shipped, but confirming the raster cause + picking fix #4 needs a real-GPU `?profile` reading.
2. **AI fishing broken** (→ brief 80) — `FISHING_CAST_TILES` are pre-reorg and now off-isle, so AI `fish` never fires (Pip unaffected); same class as brief 73's tavern/festival fix, which missed this constant ([open-questions.md](open-questions.md)). Baseline-mover → user sign-off.
3. **Movers teleport** (→ brief 82, user-reported 2026-06-12) — snapshot `interpolate` flag is farmer-only (`sprites.ts` `interpolate: isFarmer`), so NPCs/livestock/boats snap tile-to-tile; fix is render-only (widen the flag + a max-lerp-distance clamp for genuine jumps).

## Recent briefs (one-liners; detail in log.md)

**66–79 — shipped 2026-06-11 (Opus-plan / Sonnet-execute, committed per-brief):**
- **66** tab-resync — `SimClient` drops the straddling snapshot pair on tab-hide, resets the interp clock on show (render/transport).
- **67** pixel-snap + camera smoothing — engine `expSmooth` + `Canvas2dRenderer.pixelSnap`; lock-follow with glide-on-jump (render-only, bake byte-identical).
- **68** ambient idle life — seeded `AmbientLayer` (birds/leaves/chimney smoke), capped pools, no `Math.random` (render-only).
- **69** named system stages — `scheduler.stage()` labels + opt-in same-stage read/write bus audit; flattened order byte-identical (order-pin test).
- **70** startgold +30 uniform — cash constraint lifted (zero `would-breach-reserve`); ⚠️ baseline moved (reproducibility ×3); 15-day-close target unmet (gate is stock/encounters, not gold).
- **71** per-asset atlas recipes — recipe monolith → one file per asset + hash-cached per-sheet builds (`0 built, 6 cached` on a clean tree); see [asset-pipeline.md](asset-pipeline.md).
- **72** shared-run lobby server — `RunRegistry`: one `SimHost` per run-key, encode-once fan-out, owner-only control, late-join replay, zero-socket reaping. Determinism untouched.
- **73** travel-reachability guards — build-time connectivity-component map + gather-beat reachability guards; root cause was `TAVERN_GATHER_TILE`/`FESTIVAL_PODIUM_TILE` pointing at OCEAN in the radial world. ⚠️ baseline moved. Task 4 (WASM allocator fault) deferred.
- **74** weather-station island — new bridged `landmark`-kind region + building/antenna/beacon (render; ⚠️ may move baseline).
- **75** economy rebalance — principled [economy.md](economy.md) model (1 AP = one basic-labour action) + crop re-tune (spread 2.64×→1.59×). ⚠️ baseline moved by design; arc healthy.
- **76** loading screen — overlay covers Start→first-full-frame, dismissed off real readiness (main-thread only).
- **77** building 3D + farmhouses — weather-station hipped roof (48×48) + 5 personality-keyed cottages baked per farm (render-only).
- **78** Pip-movement — reported breakage **not reproducible**; root cause was duplicate dev processes (a spectator socket swallowed input). Regression guard added in `run-registry.test.ts`.
- **79** click-to-target + action cursor — Pip acts on a clicked tile (Chebyshev ≤ 1), slot-generic CSS cursors, pan moved to middle/right-drag.

**55–65 — 2026-06-10:** client/server split (55–58, see below); peer-interaction fix (59, see *sim behaviour*); then a render-polish wave — 60 max-zoom 3→6, 61 continuous Pip movement + AABB, 62 per-island floors, 63 zoom-out water-shimmer fix, 64 water swell + foam breathing, 65 cliff skirts. Only 59 + 61 touch sim behaviour.

> Engine brief 09 (perf) closed 2026-06-10 after a post-split re-profile answered its deferred gates — measured analysis in [performance.md](performance.md). Pip + interaction work shipped without briefs — see [player-and-interaction.md](player-and-interaction.md).

*(Briefs 49–79 are one-lined in the "Recent briefs" section above.)*

## Current sim behaviour & determinism

- **Tests/typecheck:** green; latest counts in the newest [log.md](../log.md) entry (not tracked here). farm-valley runs node-by-default with jsdom scoped to the ~9 DOM test files (vitest `projects`); `CHECK_DETERMINISM` runs its passes in parallel `worker_threads`.
- **Determinism is load-bearing**, verified `MATCH ×3` (seeds `0xc0ffee/1/42`). The contract is *same seed reproduces itself byte-for-byte* — **not** equality to pre-change numbers. The 2026-06-09 radial reorg, briefs 41–46/48 (new systems), and 70/73/74/75 (balance/region/economy) each **re-baselined outcomes by design**; reproducibility was re-verified each time. Brief 48 verified MATCH ×3 at both `ticksPerDay=20` and `1200` (raw `Math.random` in ACT paths is a nondeterminism bomb — fishing/mining use forked rng channels; grep confirms zero `Math.random` in sim-core source).
- **Headless-probe pitfall:** a headless `bootstrapSim` check **must** pass `pathfinder: new JsPathfinder()`, or `TravelSystem` is omitted and every travel-gated action silently no-ops (false "dormant"). See [open-questions.md](open-questions.md) for the JS-vs-WASM route caveat.
- **Leader-runaway / peer-interaction:** the old "one farmer runs away, field flat, peer layer inert" premise is **stale** (21-farmer radial field self-distributes; brief 59 fixed the peer-trade price bug + added `OFFER_CROP`). Full detail + the residual drama gaps in [open-questions.md](open-questions.md).

## Architecture milestones (no brief / cross-brief)

- **Client/server split (briefs 55–58):** the sim moved out of the browser into a Node server; the Vite app is a pure WebSocket client. Sim logic in `@farm/sim-core`; `@farm/server` hosts it; `npm run dev` runs both (Vite proxies `/sim`). Determinism held (WASM baseline). Deploy gained a pm2 + Caddy-WS phase (**dry-run-verified only — real VPS run pending**). Found along the way: JS≠WASM pathfinder routes (server uses WASM), and a fixed module-global `lastFacing` bug (now per-run `SnapshotSpriteState`). See [architecture.md](architecture.md), [decisions.md](decisions.md).
- **Post-corpus (no brief):** Canvas2D renderer (replaced WebGPU), in-house ECS (replaced miniplex), WASM pathfinding infra, the sim↔render snapshot/interpolate boundary, home screen, headless run-sim, offline world-preview, README, **Pip** + interaction systems, and the **160×160 radial archipelago** (2026-06-09). A 2026-06-06 refactor split every >300-line file into module directories fronted by barrels — see [architecture.md](architecture.md) → *Module-directory convention*.
