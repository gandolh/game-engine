# Click a building → floating Upgrade button with cost

> **UNBLOCKED 2026-06-30** — `@engine/ui` shipped ([brief 17](../briefs/engine/done/17-engine-ui-framework.md)); build this panel native to it (`@engine/ui` widget tree + the Citadel HUD pattern in `games/citadel/client/src/ui/resource-hud.ts`), not DOM. Depends on

Clicking a building should surface an **Upgrade button** over it, labelled with the
**resource cost** to upgrade to the next level.

## Current state — sim side already exists
- The `upgradeBuilding` command is wired in
  [sim-bootstrap.ts:572](../../games/citadel/sim-core/src/sim-bootstrap.ts#L572):
  owner-only, debits `upgradeCost(b.type, nextLevel)` from the stockpile, tier-gated,
  capped at `BUILDING_MAX_LEVEL` (3). Costs: L2 `{planks:4, stone:4}`, L3
  `{planks:8, stone:6, tools:2}` ([building.ts:`upgradeCost`](../../games/citadel/sim-core/src/entities/building.ts)).
- So this is **client-side surfacing** of an existing mechanic — no sim change needed.
- Building runtime `level` is in `BuildingRuntimeState`; ensure it's in the snapshot so
  the client knows the *next* level and its cost.

## Scope
1. **Building selection** — clicking a building tile (not in a placement mode) selects it.
   Today canvas click only does follow-cam / place / demolish
   ([main.ts:280](../../games/citadel/client/src/main.ts#L280)); add a select path that
   resolves the clicked tile → building (reuse the footprint→building index from the
   occupancy-badge work).
2. **Floating Upgrade button** — a pooled DOM overlay (like `OccupancyBadgeLayer`)
   positioned over the selected building via the shared `tileToScreenCss`. Label shows
   the cost to reach the next level (e.g. "Upgrade → L2: 4 planks, 4 stone"). **Disabled**
   when unaffordable / at max level / tier-locked (mirror the sim's reject reasons).
3. Clicking it sends `upgradeBuilding`; the button updates on the next snapshot.

> Pairs naturally with the **building-inspect view** todo
> ([2026-06-28-citadel-ui-building-inspect-view](2026-06-28-citadel-ui-building-inspect-view.md))
> — the upgrade button can live inside that panel rather than as a separate floater.
> Decide one home for "what happens when you click a building".

## Acceptance
- Clicking a building shows an upgrade affordance with the real cost; clicking it upgrades
  (when affordable/eligible); disabled state reads correctly. EDG32 + tests green.
