# Corpus Log

Append-only chronological record. Each entry starts with `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <kind> | <title>` so `grep '^## \[' log.md` produces a readable timeline.

## [2026-05-26] reorg | Adopt LLM Wiki pattern

Reorganized the corpus from a flat `engine/todo/` + `game/todo/` layout into the three-layer wiki pattern:
- `briefs/` for raw historical task specs (was `engine/` and `game/`)
- `wiki/` for LLM-curated synthesis pages
- `CLAUDE.md` schema, `index.md` catalog, this `log.md`

Added: [wiki/overview.md](wiki/overview.md), [wiki/architecture.md](wiki/architecture.md), [wiki/decisions.md](wiki/decisions.md), [wiki/open-questions.md](wiki/open-questions.md). Migrated `STATUS.md` → [wiki/status.md](wiki/status.md) and split its "Open gaps" section into [wiki/open-questions.md](wiki/open-questions.md).

## [2026-05-26] brief | 05-village-and-farms + 06-spatial-market drafted

Spatial restructure: 4 farms (N/E/S/W) + village center with shop and town square. Decisions made:
- World view: all 5 regions on one zoomed-out canvas (one continuous map, no scene transitions)
- Spatial coupling: posting offers + peer trades require presence in village; reading stays remote
- Shop: daily slate of 5 offers, ±10–20% off baseline, mix of buy/sell

Brief 05 (foundation) covers regions, walkable grid, pathfinder integration, travel intent + TravelSystem. Finally puts the WASM pathfinder to work — closes [open-questions.md](wiki/open-questions.md) "Pathfinder loaded but unused."

Brief 06 (depends on 05) layers in market presence enforcement, peer encounter trades, shop daily slate, and updates personalities to plan trips. Trust score gap from Brief 01 still deferred.

## [2026-05-26] status | Brief sweep + post-corpus work documented

Audited all 8 task briefs against the codebase. 7 of 8 are **done**; `01-tilemap` is **superseded** (WebGPU dropped for Canvas2D in commit `5ac7f8d`). Recorded post-corpus work that never had a brief: Canvas2D renderer, in-house ECS replacing miniplex (`020406d`), WASM pathfinding infrastructure, home screen, headless `run-sim`, `world-preview`. See [wiki/status.md](wiki/status.md).
