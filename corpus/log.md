# Corpus Log

Append-only chronological record. Each entry starts with `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <kind> | <title>` so `grep '^## \[' log.md` produces a readable timeline.

## [2026-05-26] reorg | Adopt LLM Wiki pattern

Reorganized the corpus from a flat `engine/todo/` + `game/todo/` layout into the three-layer wiki pattern:
- `briefs/` for raw historical task specs (was `engine/` and `game/`)
- `wiki/` for LLM-curated synthesis pages
- `CLAUDE.md` schema, `index.md` catalog, this `log.md`

Added: [wiki/overview.md](wiki/overview.md), [wiki/architecture.md](wiki/architecture.md), [wiki/decisions.md](wiki/decisions.md), [wiki/open-questions.md](wiki/open-questions.md). Migrated `STATUS.md` → [wiki/status.md](wiki/status.md) and split its "Open gaps" section into [wiki/open-questions.md](wiki/open-questions.md).

## [2026-05-26] status | Brief sweep + post-corpus work documented

Audited all 8 task briefs against the codebase. 7 of 8 are **done**; `01-tilemap` is **superseded** (WebGPU dropped for Canvas2D in commit `5ac7f8d`). Recorded post-corpus work that never had a brief: Canvas2D renderer, in-house ECS replacing miniplex (`020406d`), WASM pathfinding infrastructure, home screen, headless `run-sim`, `world-preview`. See [wiki/status.md](wiki/status.md).
